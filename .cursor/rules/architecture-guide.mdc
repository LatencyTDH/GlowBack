# QuantBacktest Architecture Reference
When navigating or generating code for this repository, refer to the architecture blueprint in [design.md](mdc:backtesting/design.md).

That document defines:
- Core mandate & target users
- Data ingestion and management strategy
- Strategy development interface & libraries
- Rust-based backtesting engine and execution model
- Performance analytics & visualization requirements
- Optimization & robustness testing toolkit
- Local Streamlit UI and future React dashboard
- Technology stack, deployment approach, constraints & performance goals

Assume these architectural decisions are authoritative unless explicitly overridden.
