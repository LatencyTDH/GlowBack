# Core Concepts

GlowBack is an event‑driven backtesting system. Understanding a few core concepts helps you reason about results and performance.

## Key Ideas

- **Events**: Market data is processed in chronological order across symbols.
- **Strategies**: Logic that emits orders in response to events.
- **Execution**: Orders fill with realistic slippage, latency, and commission.
- **Portfolio**: Tracks positions, cash, and P&L over time.
- **Results**: Metrics and artifacts (equity curve, trades) for evaluation.
