## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

2. Email the maintainers or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
   on the [Security tab](https://github.com/LatencyTDH/GlowBack/security).
3. Include a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and any
   potential impact.

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix or
mitigation within 7 days for critical issues.
